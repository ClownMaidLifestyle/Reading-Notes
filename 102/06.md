## javascript

Console - In-browser 
- write Js directly into it

#### Variables

**let**
i.e ``let Bungus = "bingus"``
use instead of var
variable but, better than var
doesn't need a value to be declared

**const**

constant
i.e ``const needs = "tea"``
**var**
ie. ``var Dinosaur = "Oswald"``  
Var is bad and icky, not best practise

#### Cool Commands

Console.log - check what a variable is
